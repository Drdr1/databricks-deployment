## Architecture Overview

### Primary Environment
- **Region:** East US
- **Resource Group:** rg-databricks-dev
- **Workspace:** databricks-dev
- **Key Components:**
  - Inference Cluster (ID: 0424-035941-pl8ku9sr)
  - Monitoring Cluster (ID: 0424-043008-so9kse51)
  - Inference SQL Warehouse (ID: f24fd0345a24b381)
  - Dashboard SQL Warehouse (ID: 9e61e3e42423aabc)
  - Critical Notebooks in /Shared/setup and /Shared/monitoring

### DR Environment
- **Region:** West US 2
- **Resource Group:** rg-databricks-dr
- **Workspace:** databricks-dr
- **Key Components:**
  - Standby Clusters (minimal configuration to reduce costs)
  - Data Replication Jobs
  - DR Failover Notebooks

### Data Replication
- **Method:** Delta Lake replication via scheduled jobs
- **Frequency:** Hourly
- **Storage:** Azure Blob Storage with redundancy
- **Tables Replicated:**
  - inference_db.model_predictions
  - inference_db.model_registry
  - monitoring_db.cluster_metrics
  - monitoring_db.job_metrics
  - monitoring_db.query_metrics

### Network Connectivity
- **VNet Peering:** Between primary and DR regions
- **ExpressRoute:** For secure, private connectivity
- **Azure Front Door:** For global load balancing and failover

---

## DR Strategy

Our DR strategy follows a warm standby approach, where:

1. **Primary Region (East US):**
   - Hosts active production workloads
   - Serves all user requests
   - Generates and processes data

2. **DR Region (West US 2):**
   - Maintains minimal infrastructure in a ready state
   - Receives regular data replication from primary
   - Can be scaled up quickly during failover

3. **Failover Triggers:**
   - Component failure beyond self-healing capabilities
   - Region-wide outage
   - Planned maintenance requiring region switch

4. **Recovery Approach:**
   - Component failures: Terraform-based recreation
   - Region failures: Full failover to DR region

---

## Infrastructure Components

### Terraform Modules
All infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform modules:

```
/modules/
  /workspace/       # Databricks workspace configuration
  /compute/         # Clusters and SQL warehouses
  /inference/       # Inference-related resources
  /monitoring/      # Monitoring resources
  /dashboards/      # Dashboard resources
  /unity_catalog/   # Unity Catalog resources (if used)
  /dr/              # DR-specific resources
```
