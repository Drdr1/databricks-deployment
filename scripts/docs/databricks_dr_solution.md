# Databricks Disaster Recovery Solution Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our comprehensive disaster recovery solution for the Databricks platform. The solution leverages infrastructure as code (Terraform) to automate recovery processes and enable efficient failover in case of component or regional failures. Through rigorous testing, we've validated recovery procedures and established realistic recovery time objectives (RTOs) for critical components.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Components

Our Databricks deployment consists of the following components:

- **Azure Databricks Workspace**: `databricks-dev` in region `eastus`
- **Compute Resources**:
  - Inference Cluster (`0426-040526-vsotra0p`)
  - Monitoring Cluster (`0426-035643-yxixlazl`)
  - Dashboard SQL Warehouse (`ea3657fb59ca673c`)
  - Inference SQL Warehouse (`2dfa92be4da6ac44`)
- **Jobs**:
  - Monitoring Job (`730524707704987`)
  - Dashboard Setup Jobs
  - Inference Setup Jobs
- **Supporting Infrastructure**:
  - Azure Resource Group: `rg-databricks-dev`
  - Managed Resource Group: `rg-databricks-dev-managed`

### 1.2 Deployment Method

All infrastructure is deployed using Terraform with environment-specific configuration:
- Primary environment: `environments/dev.tfvars`
- DR environment: `environments/dr.tfvars`

### 1.3 DR Design Approach

Our DR strategy follows a two-tier approach:

1. **Component-Level Recovery**: For individual component failures, we use Terraform to restore the specific component without disrupting the entire environment.

2. **Region-Level Recovery**: For catastrophic failures affecting an entire region, we maintain the capability to deploy a complete replica of our environment in a secondary region.

## 2. Disaster Recovery Test Methodology

### 2.1 Testing Framework

We've developed an automated testing framework (`run_dr_test.sh`) that guides users through:
- Simulating component failures
- Documenting impact
- Executing recovery procedures
- Validating successful recovery
- Measuring recovery time

### 2.2 Test Scenarios

Our DR testing covers the following scenarios:

1. **Component Failure Tests**:
   - Inference Cluster Failure
   - Monitoring Cluster Failure
   - Dashboard SQL Warehouse Failure
   - Inference SQL Warehouse Failure
   - Monitoring Job Failure

2. **Region Failure Test**:
   - Complete failover to secondary region
   - Failback to primary region

### 2.3 Testing Process

Each test follows a structured process:
1. **Preparation**: Review and understand the component being tested
2. **Simulation**: Deliberately create a failure condition
3. **Impact Assessment**: Document the effect of the failure
4. **Recovery**: Execute recovery procedures
5. **Validation**: Verify the component functions correctly
6. **Documentation**: Record observations and metrics

## 3. Component-Level Recovery

### 3.1 Clusters

**Recovery Procedure**:
```bash
terraform apply -target=module.compute.databricks_cluster.<cluster_name> -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

**Recovery Metrics**:
- Inference Cluster: 75 seconds recovery time
- Monitoring Cluster: [TBD after testing]

**Observations**:
- Clusters maintain their ID even after termination
- Terraform recovery is non-disruptive to other components
- No data loss occurs during recovery

### 3.2 SQL Warehouses

**Recovery Procedure**:
```bash
terraform apply -target=module.compute.databricks_sql_endpoint.<warehouse_name> -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

**Recovery Metrics**:
- Dashboard Warehouse: [TBD after testing]
- Inference Warehouse: [TBD after testing]

**Validation Requirements**:
- SQL queries execute successfully
- Dashboards refresh with current data
- Query history is preserved

### 3.3 Jobs

**Recovery Procedure**:
```bash
terraform apply -target=module.<module_name>.databricks_job.<job_name> -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

**Recovery Metrics**:
- Monitoring Job: [TBD after testing]

**Validation Requirements**:
- Job schedules are restored
- Job can be manually triggered
- Job parameters are preserved

## 4. Region-Level Recovery

### 4.1 Preparation

Before a region failover can be executed, the following preparations are required:

1. **DR Configuration**:
   - Create and maintain `environments/dr.tfvars` with secondary region settings
   - Regularly validate the configuration

2. **Data Replication**:
   - Ensure data is replicated to the secondary region
   - Validate data consistency periodically

3. **Access Configuration**:
   - Document and test access procedures for the DR environment
   - Ensure PAT tokens and authentication are prepared

### 4.2 Failover Procedure

The complete failover procedure includes:

1. **Activate Secondary Region**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/dr.tfvars
   ```

2. **Redirect Access**:
   - Update DNS entries
   - Update connection strings in dependent applications
   - Notify users of the new access point

3. **Validate Environment**:
   - Verify all clusters, warehouses, and jobs are operational
   - Test critical workflows
   - Validate data access and integrity

### 4.3 Failback Procedure

Once the primary region is available again:

1. **Update Primary Region**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```

2. **Redirect Access Back**:
   - Restore original DNS entries
   - Update connection strings to primary region
   - Notify users of the return to normal operations

3. **Validate Primary Environment**:
   - Verify all components function correctly
   - Ensure all data is consistent with the DR environment

## 5. Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)

Based on our testing, we've established the following RTOs:

| Component | Target RTO | Actual Recovery Time |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| Inference Cluster | 5 minutes | 75 seconds |
| Monitoring Cluster | 5 minutes | [TBD] |
| Dashboard SQL Warehouse | 5 minutes | [TBD] |
| Inference SQL Warehouse | 5 minutes | [TBD] |
| Monitoring Job | 10 minutes | [TBD] |
| Full Region Failover | 60 minutes | [TBD] |

## 6. Tools and Resources

### 6.1 DR Testing Script

The `run_dr_test.sh` script automates the DR testing process:
- Located at `/scripts/run_dr_test.sh`
- Requires Databricks CLI to be authenticated
- Logs all actions to a timestamped log file

### 6.2 Terraform Configuration

All infrastructure is defined in Terraform:
- Primary module structure:
  - `module.workspace`: Core Databricks workspace
  - `module.compute`: Clusters and SQL warehouses
  - `module.monitoring`: Monitoring jobs and notebooks
  - `module.inference`: Inference jobs and notebooks
  - `module.dashboards`: Dashboard jobs and notebooks

### 6.3 Authentication

DR operations require proper authentication:
- Databricks CLI authentication via browser-based login
- Terraform authentication via Azure credentials

## 7. DR Testing Schedule

We recommend the following DR testing schedule:

| Test | Frequency | Duration | Impact |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Individual Component Recovery | Monthly | 30 minutes | Minimal, isolated to component |
| Multi-Component Recovery | Quarterly | 2 hours | Moderate, may affect dependent systems |
| Region Failover | Semi-Annually | 4 hours | Significant, requires coordination |

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| DR Coordinator | Schedule tests, document results, maintain runbooks |
| Databricks Admin | Execute recovery procedures, validate functionality |
| Data Engineer | Verify data integrity, validate pipelines |
| App Support | Test downstream applications after recovery |

## 9. Continual Improvement

The DR solution should be continuously improved:

1. **Update After Changes**:
   - Review and update DR documentation after infrastructure changes
   - Re-test affected components

2. **Lessons Learned**:
   - Document lessons from each test
   - Incorporate improvements into automated scripts

3. **Expanding Coverage**:
   - Add new components to DR tests as they are deployed
   - Develop specific test cases for critical business processes
